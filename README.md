# Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny (Fall 2017)

This repository contains the workshop materials for the [Data and Visualization Services Workshop](rfun.library.duke.edu) on Developing Interactive Websites with R and Shiny.  The course description and excersises follow.

## Description

Learn how to leverage your knowledge of R (and RMarkdown) to create compelling, interactive website and interactive documents using the Shiny web application framework.  Shiny makes it easy to transition from desktop based analysis and visualizations to interactive websites without (necessarily) having to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript.  This workshop provides an overview of the shiny framework along with examples and exercises designed to build confidence in developing shiny based websites.  

### Prerequisites and Requirements

Workshop attendees should have some experience with R and R syntax to get the maximum benefit from this workshop.
